## **Overview:**
### **Assignments:**
A series of assignments focused on data analysis, simulation, and visualisation. The tasks include analysing temperate data from weather readings, organising email domains into a pie chart, simulating and visualising battles in the game of Risk, and plotting various weather statistics from Knock Airport, such as daily and monthly mean temperatures, wind speeds, and rolling windspeed averages.

Each assignment utilises libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualisation, with some tasks incorporating simulations to model real-world scenarios. 

### **Project:**
This project demonstrates my skills in data analysis by analysing a bank transaction dataset. The dataset includes transaction records and customer details, with the aim of identifying patterns that could indicate fraudulent activity. Using this dataset, I apply data manipulation, exploration, and visualisation techniques to uncover trends and insights related to customer behaviour and transaction anomalies.
