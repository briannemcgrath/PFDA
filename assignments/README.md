# Programming for Data Analytics Assignment Repository 

This repository contains code and resources related to the assignments carried out for the Programming for Data Analytics module. 

## Table of Contents: 

- [Week Two Task - Weather Data Analysis](assignment02-weather.ipynb/)
- [Week Three Task - Email Domain](assignment03-pie.ipynb/)
- [Week Five Task - Risk Simulation](assignment05-risk.ipynb)
- [Week Six Task - Knock Airport Weather](assignment06-weather.ipynb)

### Week Two Task:
Assignment Brief - In this notebook, we analyse temperature data from the weather readings dataset. The focus is on visualising the changes in temperature over time. We use Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for plotting and visualisation. 

### Week Three Task:
Assignment Brief - In this notebook, we organise email domains into a pie chart.

### Week Five Task:
Assignment Brief - This assignment simulates and visualises battles in the game of Risk. We begin by simulating individual battle rounds between a 3-dice attacker and a 2-dice defender, following Risk's combat rules. We then extend this to a full battle where two armies, each starting with 40 troops, fight until one side is eliminated.

### Week Six Task:
Assignment Brief - This assignment plots the following from weather readings in Knock Airport: 
- Mean Temperature Each Day 
- Mean Temperature for Each Month
- Windspeed 
- Rolling Windspeed (Over 24 Hours)
- Max Windspeed Each Day 
- Monthly Mean of the Daily Max Windspeeds
