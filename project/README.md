# Programming for Data Analytics Project Repository 

This repository contains code and resoruces related to project carried out for the Programming for Data Analytics module. 

## Project Overview: 
This project aims to demonstrated my skills in data analysis based on my learnings in the module through the analysis of a [bank transaction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/bank-transaction-dataset-for-fraud-detection/data). The dataset includes transaction records and customer details, with the goal of identifying patterns that can potentially indicate fraudulent behaviour. 

## Dataset Overview: 

The dataset, linked about, contains the following features: 
- **TransactionID:** Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **AccountID:** Unique identifier for the customer's account. 
- **TransactionAmount:** Amount ($) involved in the transaction. 
- **TransactionDate:** Date and time the transaction took place. 
- **Location:** Location in which the transaction was made. 
- **DeviceID:** Device used for the transaction. 
- **IP Address:** IP address in which the transaction originiated. 
- **MerchantID:** ID of the merchant involved in the transaction. 
- **CustomerAge:** Age of the customer making the transaction. 
- **TransactionDuration:** Duration of the transaction. 
- **LoginAttempts:** Number of login attempts before a successful transaction. 
- **AccountBalance:** Balance in the customer's account at the time of the transaction. 
- **PreviousTransactionDate:** The date of the previous transaction made by the customer.  

## Prerequisites/How to Run:
